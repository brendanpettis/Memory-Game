This is a simple memory game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The objective of the game is to find matching pairs for all of the cards by clicking on them.

If you make too many moves, your star rating decreases.

After successfully matching all cards, a pop up will display the results of your game.

You may restart at any time.

Enjoy! (:
